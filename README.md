**Manage Your Portfolio with Ease - No More Redeploys for Content Updates!**

## Description

`my-port/Admin` is a dedicated administration application designed to streamline the management of your static portfolio website, particularly those hosted via platforms like GitHub Pages.

This application directly addresses this pain point. With `my-port/Admin`, you can effortlessly manage all your key portfolio components, including:

* **Education:** Add, edit, and organize your educational background.
* **Employment:** Maintain your professional work experience and job details.

* **Publications:** List your publications, articles, and contributions.

Built with a modern tech stack of **React + Vite** for a fast and responsive frontend and **Firebase** for a reliable and scalable backend, `my-port/Admin` empowers you to update your portfolio content in real-time without the cumbersome process of redeploying your entire static site.
